  loreText: While out exploring the strange forest today, I found this old, brown
    cloak. On my way home, I ended up getting lost. (Stupid, I know.) Without my
    lantern and with the temperture dropping, I decided to put on the musty, old
    thing. To my surprise, the robe helped me see through the darkness. Fascinating!
